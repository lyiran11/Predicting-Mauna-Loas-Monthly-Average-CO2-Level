# Predicting Mauna Loa's Monthly Average CO2 Level by Using Time Series Models
This group project was done in March, 2021. Our team aimed to predict the monthly average of CO2 level in April, 2021 based on historical data from Mauna Loa Observatory. We used the dataset of monthly mean carbon dioxide from March 2007 to February 2021 (total of 168 months) measured at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, 2021). We utilized ITSM software to fit the ARMA(1,1) model on the residuals obtained by removing seasonality and trend. To further test whether the final residuals are IID noise, we conducted the Ljung-Box test, McLeod-Li test, turning point test, different sign test, and rank test to test if residuals are IID noise. The p-values for all five tests failed to reject the null hypothesis. In order to test whether the ARMA model makes accurate predictions, we performed predictions on the last three existing observations for December 2020, January 2021, and February 2021 based on the ARMA model constructed from the first 165 observations. The results show that our ARMA model works well for prediction. We then used this model to make our final prediction for the monthly average of CO2 level in April, 2021, which is 419.05 ppm. 
And it turned out the actual value released later on National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration is exactly the same as our prediction.
